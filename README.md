# Waggle: LAPDOG VS. LAPCAT 

## Overview 

This is Udacity’s second project under the Nanodegree Program Data Analysis and Visualization with Microsoft Power BI and focuses on creating visualization using Power BI. (Completed on October 24, 2023) 

For our second project, we were tasked with a boardroom-ready Power BI report that tells the story of how the Lapcat data compares to findings from the dog collar Lapdog devices. Lapcat and Lapdog are both devices owned by a fictional pet startup company called Waggle. 

## Business Requests 

- The CEO is curious about the following questions: 

  - Did the average daily steps increase for cats wearing the device as they did for dogs? 

  - Were owners of Lapcat devices as satisfied with the product as Lapdog owners? 

- The Chief Marketing Officer would like the report to be “on-brand” by including only colors from the Waggle color palette, the Waggle logo, and other approved company logos and icons. 

The product team would like to incorporate other visuals and insights as we see fit but is most interested in demographic comparisons between the dogs and cats using Waggle devices as well as any information about the families who own the pets. They would also like slicers to help them filter and explore on their own. 

 
## Udacity Project Requests 

- Review the included data model and business questions and identify which fields can be used to design metrics that answer the CEO’s questions.  

- Develop one or more visualizations that specifically address the CEO’s questions about whether there was a difference in average daily steps over time between the two devices and how Lapcat owners rated their device compared to Lapdog owners. 

- Address the product team’s request for demographic insights, using each of the following visuals at least once: Bar chart, line chart, donut chart, table/matrix, scatter plot, bubble map, and card. 

- Place data visualizations and design an appropriate layout that emphasizes the most important findings first, with the CEO's questions answered on the first page, insights about the differences between dogs and cats on the second, and insights about the families who own the pets on the third. 

- In the data visualizations, incorporate the branding elements requested by the Chief Marketing Officer. 

- Include at least five slicers on each page with at least one example of a drop-down slicer, at least one example of a slider slicer, at least one example of a hierarchy slicer, at least one example of a slicer with “Select All” enabled, and one example of a slicer with the search box enabled. 

- Create at least two bookmark features. One must allow users to dynamically swap one visual out with a different one and another must reset all applied filters on the page. 

- Create buttons that help your users navigate your report. Buttons must respond when users hover over them by changing color or size (or both!). 

 
## Data Model 

The data model was already provided and prepared for analysis by Udacity.
